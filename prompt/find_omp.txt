The list of calling functions contained in the function fragment is "function_list". Please use the code block (``` the name of the called function) to provide the omp primitives that have an effect on the called function.Please pay special attention to the original language containing "parallel"
For example
void adi(void) {
#pragma omp parallel
compute_rhs (); }
Then it should be the output.
```compute_rhs
#pragma omp parallel
```
