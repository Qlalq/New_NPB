> *Considering*
penMP parallelization*
> The user wants me to parallelize tasks in the provided code using OpenMP, with
a focus on best practices. Specifically, they want OpenMP pragmas added inside the `verify` function
to parallelize tasks like array initialization, computing differences, and printing. They didn’t provide
the omp directives added outside the function, but I'll make sure to focus on where I should parallel
ze within the function. I'll provide a full code sample with appropriate OpenMP pragmas for those tasks
 following the instructions given.

> *Parallelizing the code*
> The user asks for parallelism using OpenMP while keeping printing serial. I’ll
parallelize the initialization and difference computation loops like the user suggests (using `#pragma
omp parallel for`) but will avoid parallelizing the print statements. Printing should happen in order
 so I’ll use `#pragma omp single` for serial sections. For the calculations, I’ll ensure appropriate
`private` declarations, and for reductions, I'll consider how to handle the boolean pointer needed for
verification. I'll provide this structure while adhering to the user's requirement.
